[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-Click_Here-blue?style=for-the-badge)](#) *(https://richardmalo.github.io/truemortgagemath/)*

Most online mortgage calculators are basic lead-generation widgets that stop at "how much is my monthly payment." 

This project is different. It is a mathematically rigorous, fully interactive financial planning tool designed to answer the real strategic questions homebuyers and investors face: *When does my PMI drop off? How much do I save with accelerated bi-weekly payments? Should I pay off my 3% mortgage early, or invest that extra cash in the S&P 500?*

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. The Opportunity Cost Analyzer (The "Warren Buffett" Feature)
Visually compares the net worth impact of two distinct strategies: 
* **Path A:** Putting extra cash flow toward paying down your mortgage early.
* **Path B:** Paying the standard mortgage and investing the extra cash flow into the market. 
* *Why it matters:* This chart proves mathematically whether early debt payoff makes you wealthier or poorer in the long run.

### 2. True PITI & Dynamic PMI Drop
Calculates the *true* cost of homeownership by including Property Taxes, Homeowners Insurance, HOA fees, and Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).
* **Smart LTV Tracking:** The calculator dynamically tracks your Loan-to-Value ratio. The exact month your balance drops below 80% LTV, the PMI payment is automatically removed from your schedule and visualizations.

### 3. Accelerated Repayment Strategies
Instantly calculate and visualize the impact of different payment frequencies. Compare standard Monthly payments against Semi-Monthly, Bi-Weekly, and **Accelerated Bi-Weekly** schedules to see exactly how many years you can shave off your loan.

### 4. International Mathematical Accuracy
Includes a toggle for compounding frequency to accommodate international standards:
* **US Standard:** Monthly Compounding
* **Canadian Standard:** Semi-Annual Compounding (Crucial for precise penny-accurate math for Canadian users).

### 5. Progressive Disclosure UI
Built with an elegant, clutter-free user interface. Complex tools like PITI Escrow and the Opportunity Cost Analyzer are hidden behind intuitive toggles, ensuring first-time buyers aren't overwhelmed while giving power users the granular control they crave. Includes a fully responsive Dark/Light mode.
